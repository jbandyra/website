    "title": "My story \uD83D\uDD70",
    "description": "English as a language as well as the culture of the English-speaking world have always been my passion. The drive to develop it has guided me through several steps of academic, professional and private life. Starting as an English teacher, I quickly realized how important it is to satisfy the needs of your pupils. I treat each and every step they take to develop their foreign language skills as personal success. It is no different when it comes to translation. Every satisfied customer whom I helped to communicate in a foreign language has motivated me to vigorously continue my work."
